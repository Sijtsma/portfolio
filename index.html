                        <h1>Accessibility Specialist</h1>
                    </header>
                        <p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.firmground.nl">Firm Ground</a> as a Junior Advisor Digital Accessibility. For me, this role is perfect as it sits on the crossroad of UX research and media studies. It allows me to understand how the Internet can become accessible to all, the intricacies of different user experiences and understanding the role of software as a societal facilitator.</p>
                        <p>My day-to-day tasks involve project planning, auditing websites and apps, advising organizations and hosting training sessions for developers and web editors.</p>
                        <p>My goals for the coming years is to become a usability and accessibility specialist, preferrably on apps. I will place any progress I'll make towards this goal here. So, do come back!</p>
                        <p>By the way, I made this page to understand accessible software development. If you have any remarks, you can notify me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sijtsma/">my Linkedin</a>.</p>

            <h2>Research Projects</h2>
                <p>I have worked on several research projects during my studies. I describe them in the following sections in chronological order from newest to oldest.</p>

                        <h1>Harvard Misinformation Review</h1>
                    </header>
                        <p>I was part of a group that helped my Professor <a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/r/o/r.a.rogers/r.a.rogers.html">Richard Rogers</a> sift through data to help structure a research project during a graduate course. Professor Rogers continued working on the project and published the results of this work in the Harvard Misinformation Review, called <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-the-scale-of-facebooks-problem-depends-upon-how-fake-news-is-classified/">Research note: The scale of Facebook’s problem depends upon how ‘fake news’ is classified</a>.</p>

                        <h1>Journal Article in Javnost-The Public</h1>
                    </header>
                        <p>Together with one of my assistent-professors and another student, we planned, executed and published an article that has been reviewed by peers. We aimed to understand rational-critical debate through the development of a coding manual to establish whether traces of a public sphere could be found in the mentions between Dutch parliamentarians on Twitter. </p>
                        <p>The full article <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13183222.2020.1794408">'Online Deliberation and the Public Sphere'</a> is open-access. Enjoy the read and don't hesitate to contact me about it.</p>

                        <h1>Who Knows Your Sleeping Score?</h1>
                    </header>
                        <p>During my graduate degree, I was part of a research project where we performed a critical analysis of companion mobile apps (CMAs) of fitness-tracking wristbands and their connection to third-party software.</p>

                        <h1>Social Media and the Public Sphere in The Netherlands</h1>
                    </header>
                        <p>The first research project I joined was a conference paper where I was labelling tweets according to several variables. I then joined to co-author and help finish the paper in time for the <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/115">European Consortium of Political Research Conference in Hamburg, Germany</a>.</p>
                        <p>Despite its consequences for democracy, little research has been devoted to the study of how social media relate to the public sphere. Assessing the existence of rational deliberation between MPs will deepen our understanding of political deliberation in the social media age and open new avenues to further investigate how social media are affecting the public sphere. The paper <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/40840">'Social Media and the Public Sphere in The Netherlands'</a> is available online.</p>
